CodeCademy project - Rooster Regulation

An experimental rooster object has been developed without any tests! Itâ€™s up to you to write them.

Objectives:
1. To create a fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable, and expressive test suite 
2. The test suite must provide confidence that the rooster is functioning correctly and acts as a form of documentation (i.e. it's expressive) for other developers.

The rooster is defined in index.js. 
Write the test suite in index_test.js within the test directory using the Mocha test framework 
and assert methods from the Node.js standard library.

If unsure about any of the methods, use the documentation linked below:

mocha - https://mochajs.org/
assert - https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html
